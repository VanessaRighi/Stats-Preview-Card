### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources


[MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-left-radius) - This helped me to adjust the border radius of each side of my containers.

- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-define-two-column-layout-using-flexbox/#:~:text=Approach%3A%20To%20create%20a%20two,all%20will%20come%20as%20columns.) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to divide a flexbox.

- [W3docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-overlay-one-div-over-another.html) - This is an amazing guida that helped me to do theoverlay part of this project. I am not sute if it was needed here, but it was the solution that I found!
